# Porites astreoides genome

# Sample collection

One adult *Porites astreoides* colony was collected from Baileyâ€™s Bay Reef Flats in Bermuda on June 12, 2017 and cored into genetic replicates. The replicates were held under ambient conditions for 14 days (28&deg;C with 12:12hr light cycle at ~115 umol photons) and then exposed to heated conditions (31&deg;C with 12:12hr light cycle at ~115 umol photons) for 59 days. Samples were immediately snap frozen and stored at -80&deg;C on August 28, 2017.

Corals were collected under permit 17060807 from the Government of Bermuda Department of Environment and Natural Resources.
