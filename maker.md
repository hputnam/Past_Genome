title: Genome annotation with MAKER

### What is MAKER?

MAKER is a genome annotation pipeline from the [Yandell lab](http://www.yandell-lab.org/software/maker.html). 
As described on the page "Its purpose is to allow smaller eukaryotic and prokaryotic genome projects to independently annotate their genomes and to create genome databases. MAKER identifies repeats, aligns ESTs and proteins to a genome, produces ab-initio gene predictions and automatically synthesizes these data into gene annotations having evidence-based quality values."  

A tutorial is available with details and explanations at [MAKER Tutorial](http://gmod.org/wiki/MAKER_Tutorial).
